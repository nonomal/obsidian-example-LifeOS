- A project is a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.

A project refers to a task or activity with clear objectives and deadlines.

For example:

- Writing a book (3 months)
- Developing an app (6 months)
- Designing a website (2 weeks)
- Planning a weekend barbecue (1 day)

Projects are more specific compared to areas and represent the smallest unit of execution for completing a task.

Projects have the following characteristics:

1. Clear start and expected completion time
2. Concrete goals and expected deliverables
3. Can be broken down into a series of tasks with sequential relationships
4. Generate tangible value or impact upon completion

Projects do not necessarily have to be highly complex; even small goals in everyday life can be considered as projects.

In relation to areas, projects help in realizing the vision within a particular field.

For example:

Area: Front-end development

Related projects:

- Setting up the React project architecture (1 week)
- Implementing login/registration functionality (3 days)
- Refactoring data flow (2 days)

By consistently completing these projects that contribute to the area, one can continuously improve and grow within that field.

Projects and areas support each other and are important dualities in the P.A.R.A. system.
