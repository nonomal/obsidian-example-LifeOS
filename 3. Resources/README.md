- Resources are a topic or theme of ongoing interest.

Resources refer to the information and knowledge you acquire from external sources that support and deepen your areas to a certain extent.

For example:

- **Interests**
  - Web design
  - Woodworking
  - Disc golf
  - Biohacking
- **Topics**
  - Psychology
  - Politics
  - Leadership
  - Integrity
- **Assets**
  - Stock photos
  - Typography references
  - Marketing swipe files
  - Product recommendations
  - Code snippets

Continuously drawing nutrients from these resources provides a foundation for projects to have an impact and for areas to deepen continuously.

Therefore, resources are also an essential part of the P.A.R.A system.
