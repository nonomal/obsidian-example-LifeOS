- An area is a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.

A area refers to the field or area that you need to continuously improve and focus on.

It can be understood as your work and interest areas. By continuously accumulating knowledge and experience in these areas, you can achieve success.

For example:

- Work areas
    - Front-end development
    - Product design
- Interest areas
    - Interior design
    - Gardening
- Life areas
    - Health management
    - Interpersonal relationships

By continuously working on projects and learning resources in these areas, your knowledge and abilities will continuously improve, leading to accomplishments.

The division of areas should be based on individual circumstances, focusing on a few areas that can be pursued consistently. Projects and resources serve as tools to help you excel within these areas.

Areas can be broad and ambitious, such as "benefiting society" or "personal fulfillment," or they can be very specific and specialized, such as "React development." Based on your abilities and interests, dividing areas in a thoughtful manner can greatly aid in your pursuit of excellence.

Areas may also change over time and circumstances, but the overall direction should remain consistent. Only by aiming at accurate goals can you make progress in your pursuit of excellence.
