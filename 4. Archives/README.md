- The archive is inactive items from the other three categories.

Archives refer to information that is no longer actively engaged with or maintained but may be useful in the future.

For example:

- Old project files
- Expired resources
- Unused notes

Information in the archives possesses the following characteristics:

1. No longer active in the present
2. Still potentially valuable for future reference
3. Does not require frequent consultation or maintenance
4. Remains searchable

Archiving information does not mean directly discarding it but rather adjusting its status to no longer actively participate in updates and maintenance.

For example:

Project: Completed manuscript

Resource: Watched videos yet to be organized

Area: Former interests no longer focused on

And other types of information can be categorized and archived.

In the future, if needed, they can still be retrieved through search or other methods.

Compared to passive deletion, archiving can:

1. Reduce search difficulty
2. Avoid information loss
3. Improve manageability

Therefore, archiving serves as an essential module in the P.A.R.A system.
